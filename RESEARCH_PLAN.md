# MLCC Research Plan

> Companion to [AGENTS.md](./AGENTS.md). Defines **what** to research, **where** to look, **how** to record findings, and **in what order**. Tick boxes (`[ ]` → `[x]`) as items complete.

## 0. Conventions

### 0.1 Source quality tiers (cite the highest available)
1. **T1 — Manufacturer datasheet / official catalog** (Murata, SEMCO, TDK, Taiyo Yuden, Yageo, …). Record revision/date.
2. **T2 — Standards documents** (EIA RS-198, IEC 60384-1/-21/-22, AEC-Q200, JIS C 5101, JEDEC).
3. **T3 — Peer-reviewed papers** (J. Am. Ceram. Soc., J. Eur. Ceram. Soc., JJAP, IEEE TCPMT, Acta Materialia).
4. **T4 — Granted patents** (USPTO, EPO, KIPRIS, JPO via Google Patents / Espacenet).
5. **T5 — Industry whitepapers, conference proceedings** (CARTS, PCNS, ECTC, IMAPS).
6. **T6 — Vendor app notes, technical blogs** (use only as pointers; verify against T1–T4).

### 0.2 File conventions
- One topic per Markdown file; lowercase-kebab filename.
- YAML front matter on every note:
  ```yaml
  ---
  title: ...
  pillar: manufacturing | market | literature | design-rules
  sources: [{tier: T1, ref: "Murata GRM datasheet rev. K, 2024-09"}]
  tags: [BaTiO3, X7R, ...]
  updated: YYYY-MM-DD
  ---
  ```
- Cross-link with `[[note-name]]` for wiki-style graph (compatible with the `/wiki` skill if we ingest later).
- Numeric values: always include unit; prefer SI; keep original-unit value in parentheses if datasheet uses something else.

### 0.3 Working glossary
Maintain `resources/glossary.md` — single authoritative source for abbreviations (BME, NME, TCC, DF, IR, …) and term definitions. Add a term the **first time** it appears in any note.

### 0.4 Bibliography
Maintain `resources/bibliography.md` — append-only registry of every source consulted, keyed by short citation (`[murata-grm-2024]`, `[moulson-herbert-2003]`, `[us10937593-2021]`). Notes reference by key.

## 1. Pillar 1 — Manufacturing process

**Goal:** Produce a process-step map with parameters, equipment, and dominant defect modes per step. This is the foundation for understanding *why* design rules look the way they do.

### 1.1 Research questions
- What are the canonical process steps from raw powder to finished chip?
- What are typical parameter ranges (sintering temp/atmosphere, dielectric green-tape thickness, electrode wet-print thickness, lamination pressure) per step?
- Which steps gate the achievable **layer count**, **dielectric thickness**, **case-size shrinkage**, and **electrode continuity**?
- What are the dominant **failure / yield-loss modes** per step (cracks, delamination, voids, electrode discontinuity, segregation)?
- BME (Ni-electrode, reducing atmosphere) vs NME (Pd/Ag) process trade-offs.

## 4. Pillar 4 — Design rules & specs

### 4.1 Sub-deliverables in `resources/design-rules/`

## 5. Sequencing

Execution order (each item assumes the previous is at least scaffolded — don't wait for completeness):

1. **Foundation** — write `glossary.md`, `bibliography.md` stubs; ingest **EIA RS-198** and **IEC 60384-1** decoded into `design-rules/10-dielectric-classes.md` and `70-standards-reference.md`.
2. **Manufacturing skeleton** — `manufacturing/00-overview.md` end-to-end map (one paragraph per step). Defer parameter ranges to later passes.
3. **Market matrix v0** — collect Murata + SEMCO catalogs into `market/10-lineup-matrix.csv` for case sizes 0402–1206 across X7R/X5R/C0G. Expand to TDK + TY in v1, others in v2.
4. **Design fundamentals** — `design-rules/00-fundamentals.md`, `20-voltage-derating.md`, `30-frequency-domain.md`, `40-aging-and-temperature.md`. Use Murata's DC-bias data and app notes as primary T1 sources.
5. **Literature first pass** — `literature/00-reading-list.md` with ~30 prioritized papers across the four subtopics; full annotations come in later passes.
6. **Patent first pass** — table of top-10 patents per major assignee from the last decade.
7. **Manufacturing parameter pass** — fill the per-step files with actual ranges and defect-mode catalogs.
8. **Design rule synthesis** — `design-rules/90-design-rule-checklist.md`: turn the corpus into an executable selection procedure.
9. **Iterate** — Tier-2/3 vendors, deep patent reading, reliability physics deep-dive.

Stop and reassess after each milestone — don't fall into a single rabbit hole.

## 6. Success criteria

The plan is "done enough to be useful" when:
- The **lineup matrix** covers all T1 vendors across 0402–1206 and the three workhorse dielectric classes (C0G / X5R / X7R).
- The **design-rule checklist** can be applied to a new design without re-deriving from datasheets — it cites them.
- A new reader can answer, from `resources/` alone: *"Why does a 0402 X7R 10 µF 6.3 V part only deliver ~3 µF at 5 V DC bias, and what would I substitute if I need 8 µF at that bias?"*

---

## 7. Tooling notes

- The `/wiki` skill (if loaded) can ingest `resources/` into a graph-linked knowledge base — useful once the corpus crosses ~30 notes. Until then, manage manually with `[[wiki-links]]`.
- Web/PDF gathering will happen in subsequent turns via `WebFetch` / `WebSearch`; do not download large binaries into the repo — store URLs in `market/20-datasheets/README.md` and only pull PDFs that are critical.
- Keep every note short enough to be a "page in a binder" — split rather than letting any file exceed ~400 lines.
